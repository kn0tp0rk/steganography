I like to note-take while I read. My notes have grown more and more verbose as I try to learn about reading and writing. I wanted to use steganography for…something. Voilà. Hidden book reviews. Well, not entirely. You can find these on Goodreads and StoryGraph, but I can't put those on my resume, can I?

Requirements
	• A steganography tool like OpenPuff
	• A PDF reader like FoxIt
	• A file unzipper like 7zip

Instructions
	1. Download the files and unzip them.
	2. Open and solve the crossword puzzle. Answers are lowercase and do not include spaces.
	3. Open your steganography tool and choose "Unhide".
	4. Add ALL downloaded images as a carrier.
	5. Enter the crossword answers respectively into spot A, B, C.
	6. Select "Unhide."
	7. The book review(s) are now available for you.
